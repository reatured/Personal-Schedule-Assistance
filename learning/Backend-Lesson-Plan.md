# Backend Development Lesson Plan (Project-Based)

## üóìÔ∏è Overview
This lesson plan is designed to help you learn backend development fundamentals by building and iterating on your Time Schedule Builder project.

---

## Week 1: Backend Fundamentals & Project Setup

### Day 1: Introduction to Backend & Project Initialization
- What is backend development? (APIs, databases, authentication, etc.)
- Overview of your project's architecture (frontend, backend, data flow)
- Set up your project repo, install dependencies, and review the file structure

### Day 2: Data Modeling & Local Storage
- What is data modeling? (entities, relationships)
- Define your main data models (e.g., Project, Schedule, Task)
- Implement local storage logic for saving and loading schedules (as you have now)

### Day 3: Introduction to APIs
- What is an API? REST vs. GraphQL (focus on REST for now)
- Set up a simple API route in Next.js (e.g., `/api/schedules`)
- Implement GET and POST endpoints for schedules (using in-memory or local storage)

### Day 4: CRUD Operations
- What are CRUD operations? (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Expand your API to support updating and deleting schedules
- Connect your frontend to these API endpoints

### Day 5: Error Handling & Validation
- Why is error handling important?
- Add error handling to your API routes
- Add basic validation for schedule data

## Week 2: Advanced Backend Concepts

### Day 6: Introduction to Databases
- What is a database? (SQL vs. NoSQL, focus on SQL for now)
- Introduction to SQLite or PostgreSQL (local development)
- Set up a simple database and connect it to your project

### Day 7: Database Integration
- Migrate your local storage logic to use a real database
- Implement database CRUD operations in your API

### Day 8: Authentication & Authorization (Optional)
- What is authentication? What is authorization?
- (Optional) Add simple authentication (e.g., with NextAuth.js or JWT)
- Protect your API routes

### Day 9: Deployment & Environment Variables
- What is deployment? Why do we use environment variables?
- Prepare your project for deployment (Vercel, Netlify, or your own server)
- Store secrets and config in environment variables

### Day 10: Testing & Documentation
- Introduction to testing (unit, integration, API tests)
- Write simple tests for your API routes
- Document your API endpoints (README or Swagger)

## üèÅ Tips for Success
- **Build as you learn:** Apply each concept directly to your project.
- **Keep a dev journal:** Write down what you learn and any issues you face.
- **Ask for feedback:** Share your code and get reviews if possible.
- **Iterate:** Don't be afraid to refactor as you learn better ways to do things.
