# 2024-06-29 Progress & Plan

## ⏳ Estimated Total Time
About 2-3 hours

## 📌 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up Local Development Environment (Estimated: 40 min)

#### a. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### b. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### c. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your database URL and secret key
```

#### d. Set Up PostgreSQL Database
- If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, install it (e.g., with Homebrew: `brew install postgresql`).
- Start PostgreSQL:  
  ```bash
  brew services start postgresql
  ```
- Create your database:
  ```bash
  createdb schedule_db
  ```
- Update your `.env` file with the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2. Initialize FastAPI Project Structure (Estimated: 30 min)
- Make sure you have these folders and files in `backend/app/`:
  - `main.py`
  - `routers/`
  - `models/`
  - `schemas/`
  - `core/`
- If any are missing, create them.

---

### 3. Run Your First API (Estimated: 20 min)

#### a. Start the FastAPI Server
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### b. Test the API
- Open your browser and go to:  
  [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- Check if you see the FastAPI docs.
- If you have a `/ping` endpoint, try it. If not, add this to `main.py`:
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI

  app = FastAPI()

  @app.get("/ping")
  def ping():
      return {"message": "pong"}
  ```
- Save and refresh the docs, then test `/ping`.

---

### 4. Read Backend Learning Material (Estimated: 30 min)
- Open `learning-material/backend-basics.md`.
- Read through the explanations of backend concepts, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic.

---

### 5. Record Issues and Solutions (Estimated: 10 min)
- As you work, write down any problems you encounter and how you solved them in this file under the sections below.
